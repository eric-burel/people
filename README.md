# People of Go
Event-based people simulation, written in go


People Of Go allow you to simulate randomized people behaviour. Each simulated person triggers events depending on its habits.

## What is it for

People Of Go is primarily meant for company day-to-day life simulation. Events are triggered by either simulated users, cutomers or employees.
The generated data then can be used to test information systems (anomaly detector for example).
